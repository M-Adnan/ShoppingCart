# ShoppingCart
Hi,

I went in with a mindset of creating a small console shopping cart application and tried to make it error free and userfriendly as possible. In the process I put in lots of out and in messages everywhere. When I started writing unit test cases I realised the approach and focus of creating this console should have been totally different. Rather than focusing on the user experience and display messages I should have created small self contained simple single purpose methods that can easily be unit tested. Realising my mistake a bit later on I thought I should submit the excercise as it is with some explanation. I hope this excercise will demonstrate my grasp on C#, OOP concepts and design pattren.
